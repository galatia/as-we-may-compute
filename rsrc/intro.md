**The Future of Computation.** 

- **Computation Foundations**. Software is developed atop a brittle tower of supporting systems whose fundamental concepts were solidified in the 1970s. What would a green-field computing system look like, building on the hardware and research literature that exists today?
  - (FIX THIS) Today's computing systems follow several ubiquitous patterns grounded in the [[1950s-70s]](Systems Past). They don't take into account ideas that were conceived of since. Nor have concepts whose implementation was deemed impractical (given the hardware limitations of the time) been seriously revisited.

- **Computational Thought**. Artificial intelligence has been just 20 years away for over 50 years. Advances in *deep learning* have recently cracked some of the most persistently daunting problem domains, such as human-level [[visual object recognition]] and [[scene understanding]]. How does it achieve this, and how can it be leveraged towards general human-level AI?
  - (TODO)

- **Computation-Aided Thought**. Computers possess tremendous potential to [[augment human intelligence]], by helping people to organize information, perform simulations, and reason about implications. How can we achieve the highest productivity of interactions
