**The Future of Computation.** Our research concerns the unrealized potential of the computing system as a seamless device to support and extend the human mind. In particular, we are investigating three interrelated directions through which we believe computation can be improved:

- **Computation Foundations**. Software is developed atop a brittle tower of supporting systems whose fundamental concepts were solidified in the 1970s. What would a green-field computing system look like, building on the more advanced hardware and research literature that exists today?
    * (FIX THIS) Today's computing systems follow several ubiquitous patterns grounded in the [[1950s-70s]](Systems Past). They don't take into account ideas that were conceived of since. Nor have concepts whose implementation was deemed impractical (given the hardware limitations of the time) been seriously revisited.
- **Computational Thought**. Advances in *deep learning* have recently cracked some of the most persistently daunting problem domains in artificial intelligence, such as human-level [[visual object recognition]] and [[scene understanding]]. How does it achieve this, and how can it be leveraged towards general human-level AI?
    * (TODO)
- **Computation-Aided Thought**. Computers possess tremendous capacities to [[augment human intelligence]], by helping people to organize information, perform simulations, and reason about implications. How can a computational system best add value while conserving its human counterpart's limited attention?

Through these three directions, we hope to shed some light on how computing can be both more efficient and more enjoyable in the future, and to demonstrate implementations of various aspects of this vision.
